<h1>Data Augmenting Dialogues for Improving Emotional Support Chatbots</h1>

We are researching ways to extend a crowdsourced conversational dataset through prompting language models. Current research has shown that fine-tuning on synthetic dialogues generated by prompting ChatGPT can improve a downstream language model's ability to provide emotional support compared to solely fine-tuning on human data. Our research investigates if it's possible to generate synthetic dialogues comparable to those generated by ChatGPT, through prompting smaller language models in various ways, and subsequently fine-tuning a downstream language model on these dialogues in an effort to improve its capacity for providing emotional support. The advantages and disadvantages of the prompting techniques are further investigated. The overarching method is grounding the prompts on crowdsourced data, to try to mimic the statistical attributes of the crowdsourced data, and reduce the complexity of generating realistic dialogues.

Sarcasm, characterized by its sharp, ironic wit that communicates the opposite of its literal meaning, serves as a powerful tool in human communication, usually to humorous or biting effect. When someone says, “Oh, you almost gave me a heart attack!” in response to a well-predicted behavior, the words convey surprise but the tone and facial expression imply the opposite. In recent years, researchers have made strides in sarcasm recognition, particularly in leveraging multimodal data for enhanced detection accuracy [1]. Building upon this, subsequent research endeavors have focused on refining fusion strategies [2], [3]. Despite these advancements in fusion strategy development, there remains a gap in exploring the linguistic insight of sarcasm detection systems. Limited research has been done to investigate the interplay of prosodic and visual cues of sarcasm. Accordingly, this study aims to investigate the dynamic interplay between prosodic features and visual expressions in sarcasm. The methodology we elaborate here involves participants evaluating video content and spontaneously incorporating sarcasm in their expressions, thus providing them greater autonomy in selecting sarcastic cues from various modalities. Given the inherent ambiguity of sarcasm in certain contexts, we employ a rigorous annotation process to mitigate this variability. In this process, participants identify the cues employed, while listeners discern their perception of these messages. This approach provides a holistic view of the multimodal cues utilized in both the production and perception of sarcasm. We conduct k-means clustering to identify the most effective combinations of multimodal cues that lead to accurate sarcasm perception by analyzing clusters corresponding to high sarcasm perception rates. Diverging from previous studies predominantly focused on English, our research employs a comparative analysis across English, Mandarin, and Dutch. Our findings show how individuals from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds employ non-verbal cues including prosody to convey and interpret discourse, providing novel linguistic insight to multimodal sarcasm detection.

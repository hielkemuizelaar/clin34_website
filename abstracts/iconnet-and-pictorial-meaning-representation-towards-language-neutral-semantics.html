<h1>IconNet and Pictorial Meaning Representation: Towards Language-Neutral Semantics</h1>
<h3>Xiao Zhang, Johan Bos</h3>

<br>
Current meaning representation formalism in NLP use natural language (usually English) to denote concepts, predicates, and relations. We investigate the possibilities of developing a WordNet-based ontology where synsets/concepts are represented by icons.  The resulting IconNet resource is combined with graph-based semantic representations to capture the meaning of a sentence or short text, resulting in a multi-modal meaning representation combining textual and pictorial elements. We believe that the integration of these modalities significantly enhances the flexibility and applicability of  meaning representations in diverse communicative contexts.

Mainstream pornography sustains socio-cultural stereotypes, posing concerns for viewer perceptions and behaviours, especially among young audiences. Despite the recognised adverse effects of stereotypical pornography consumption, our understanding of the content and social dynamics that drive popular socio-cultural stereotypes in pornography remains very limited. This study employs various topic modelling techniques to explore gendered, ethnic, and racial stereotypes in online pornography. In particular, we apply bipartite graph analysis to identify communities within the network. By analysing the structure of graphs formed by pornographic content and associated metadata, including viewer demographics and engagement metrics, we seek to uncover latent patterns of stereotype prevalence and consumption. By leveraging data from Pornhub, we aim to uncover patterns of stereotype prevalence and evolution over time and unravel the complex interplay of various stereotypes within pornographic content. More specifically, metadata such as popularity and posting frequency will provide insights into the factors driving the perpetuation of stereotypes in online pornography. The ultimate goal of this project is to inform interventions promoting healthier attitudes towards sexuality, particularly among young people.

The Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands Journal (CLIN Journal) provides an international forum for the electronic publication of high-quality scholarly articles in all areas of computational linguistics, language and speech technology with special attention for research related to the Dutch language. All published papers are open access and freely available online.

CLIN Journal is linked to the yearly CLIN conference and accepts submissions of full papers based on research presented at the conference. These papers are rigorously reviewed by members of the editorial board and additional expert reviewers, and when accepted are published in a volume of the journal with as guest editor the organizer(s) of the corresponding CLIN conference.
